// NOTE BIG NOTE  please compile with makefile or if you are gonna compile by own please add -lm for math.h in client compile.
gcc -o client seeWhat.c -lm
gcc -o server timerServer.c
gcc -o show showResult.c
**** ADDED some SHIFTED INVERSE RESULTS in example .txt = 02.52 time
*** ADDED MY REFERENE PDF MADE BY SOME STUDENT IN CLASS(REFERENCE)
** bile bile bıraktım executable run hallerini sıkıntı olmasın diye compile sırasında.



LAST ENTRY 02.29

DOCUMENTATION  FILE FOR midterm 2017. 

THIS CODE has value as demo so please read carefully/write.


What does my SeeWhat and its log.do
1-it takes server pid via fifo
2-it can send signal with server pid(it sends SIGUSR1) 
for requesting matrix randomly 
3-it can get randomly created matrix from timerserver
4-it uses calculates shifted inverse prints on screen and log file
5-it calculate tiem of shifted inverse calculation very cool
6-it has ctrl c sigint signal handler for intterups from other terminals(not working %5 of times , %95 it works)
7-it can kill other terminals via its ctrl c + kill handler
8-can print og matrix and shifted ones pretty cool.
9-it forks for 2d calculation or shifted inverse, though it can only calculate shifted inverse at the moment.


what cant do (we were supposed to)
1-i didnt have time to communicate with showresults due deadline so i did "showresult job" in here
2-couldnt calculate 2d convolution just shifted inverse.


what does timerServer and its log.do
1-it sends pid to clients
2-it has signal handlers (such as sigint,sigusr1 etc)
3-it kills all terminals and prints them who killed first and others via ctrl +c
4-it prints matris determinant, milisecond and client pid  pretty cool
5-it creates random , invertible matris  2nx2n. calculates shifted_inverse(totally i wrote the code so for effort ^_^)
// co_factor function taken from stackoverflow.com (couldnt find spesific link)
6-it blocks signals for spesific time given resolution from command argument


what cant do
1-again no communcation or anything with showResults.
2-didnt look carefully for valgrind.
3-error checking is not completlely done due lack of time/deadline.




show results:
does nothing at the moment.
